## Introduction

For this project, despite being able to use libraries, we used Canvas, in order to have a better application of the learned code, and also to improve it. To do this, we created [This game](https://4epic.github.io/Project-1-Shibuya-incident/), in order to visually see what the Canvas format is capable of.

On this occasion, we thought about implementing a simple game with different logics that was updated following the player's value with the collision value. Finally, this idea was discarded, due to its apparent simplicity - Considering what we have seen, it was not going to be very simple either -, and a new "shoot'em up 2D" format was considered.

This game is thought to have the **next caracteristics**.

## Player

- 2D diagonal and vertical movement.
- Shoot energy.
- Power up.

## Enemies

- three versions:

```bash
$ Roboto
- More resist.
- Power up Inmunity 5s.
$ Slime
- Follow player.
- Power up Random.
$ Alien
- Capaz de disparar.
- Power up de Arma.
```
- Appear from any wall of the Canvas.

## Game

- Time Max. 60'.
- Ground space.
- Music & sounds.
- Score.

## Instructions

```bash
$ Move
- Should dont go off the edge.
- Control with AWSD or ARROWS.
$ Shoot
- Hard to control.
- More fast or more slow.
- Control with Mouse & click.
```

# Shoot Energy Game 
Shoot energy in this game it's not easy! You have to may use to survive in this game. When you click near the Player, the shoots gonna be more slow, and when you click so far the player, the shoots gonna be more fast. Practice!

## How does it work?
The game screen contains a Canvas where a Player dotch and shoot enemies for win score and survive 60s, last, player can see "Game Over" when die or "You Win" and his Score when survive.

All enemies appear randomly in canvas with diferent velocity.
